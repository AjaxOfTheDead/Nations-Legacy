killpoints:
  - Every time a player kills someone from a neutral/enemy nation, their killpoints will add 1 point and the
    victim will lose 1 point. Regardless of Rank.

  - If the victim and killer are at war, then ranks matter. Killpoints will now be multiplied by the
    Rank the victim was in. However, these multipliers do not affect the player's personal killpoints, but
    the war's goal.

  - If nations are at war, every kill will lower the killpointgoal of the victim's nation by 1 and increase
    the killer's killpoints based on the victim's rank.

Chunk limit:
  - Every nation has a limited amount of chunks they can claim which increases over time

End War:
  - When defeating a nation, the enemy nation's chunk limit will 
    be added to your own, and their chunk limit will be reset to the base limit
